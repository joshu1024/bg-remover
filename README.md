## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshu1024/bg-remover.git
cd bg-remover

2. Install Frontend
cd client
npm install
npm run dev


Runs frontend on http://localhost:5173

3. Install Backend
cd ../server
npm install
npm start


Runs backend on http://localhost:4000

4. Environment Variables

Create .env files in both client and server directories:

/client/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

/server/.env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

🧪 How It Works

User uploads an image via the frontend.

The frontend sends the image to the backend.

The backend sends the image to an AI model (like remove.bg or a custom segmentation API).

The background is removed, and a transparent PNG is returned to the user.

🧾 Credits System (Optional)

Users receive a limited number of credits (e.g., 200).

Each image processed deducts 1 credit.

System tracks credit usage per user session (can be implemented via JWT, localStorage, etc.).

📦 Deployment
Vercel (Frontend)

Auto-deploys from client/ folder.

Add VITE_API_URL as an environment variable in Vercel dashboard.

Backend (Optional Platforms)

Railway

Render
